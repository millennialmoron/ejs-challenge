  "To be honest, I've never been any good with keeping up with blogs regularly. I just get busy with other things and forget. I do have another, more public blog on Wordpress that I try to post on weekly. But I designed and built this one as a project for my bootcamp and to be honest I was so proud that I was able to do the whole thing without an hints or even without being told what to do from step to step that I thought I'd go ahead and publish this bad boy to potentially use for my portfolio. That's right, this guy has been built front and back end by ME! And I loved doing it!! Which reminds me, I did a ton of error-testing and debugging, but if you happen to catch some kind of problem somewhere, please oh please let me know! â™¡";
